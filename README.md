# JustJava
The JustJava application for the Android for Beginners Nanodegree. This version takes the user's name as input and calculates the price according to the user's preferences (whether or not they added whippedcream and/or chocolate). It also shows an error message (Toast) when the user orders less than 1 cup or more than 100 cups of coffee.
